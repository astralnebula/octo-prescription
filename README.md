Collection of Homebrew Short Scripts. Just what the doctor ordered. Arch / httpd version 

---

Keep in mind this will not be as robust as it should be.  I am still learning about bash variables, and creating a config file that will work with all the scripts, so my personal data isn't exposed on github. :D In other cases, i've replaced my server IP's and usernames with generic "changeme" or "example" which should be shortly after cloning.

This is basically a personal collection of helpful scripts that I end up using again and again. Feel free to use and reuse or repurpose.
